This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors related to the `calc()` function in CSS and their solutions. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The first error involves extra spaces within the `calc()` function, and the second involves mixing different units.  Solutions focus on removing unnecessary spaces and ensuring unit consistency for reliable calculations.
