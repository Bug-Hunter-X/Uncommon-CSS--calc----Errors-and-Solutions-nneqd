To address the spacing issue, remove any extra spaces within the `calc()` expression.  Always ensure a correct and compact syntax. To solve unit mixing problems, ensure you use consistent units throughout the calculation. For example, if using percentages, use percentages consistently; otherwise, use pixels or another unit consistently.  Here's a corrected version:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}

/*Consistent Units Example*/
.another-element {
  width: calc(50% + 50%); /*Correct: Both percentages */
  height: calc(100px + 100px);/*Correct: Both pixels*/
}
```
Avoid mixing units such as `calc(100px + 20%)` to prevent browser inconsistencies.
